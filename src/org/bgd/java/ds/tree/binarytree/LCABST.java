/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/
 *
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 *
 * Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
 *
