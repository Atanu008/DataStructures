//How can we keep track of the frequencies of numbers in the heap?
//When we are pushing a new number to the Max Heap,
//we donâ€™t know how many times the number has already appeared in the Max Heap.
//To resolve this, we will maintain a HashMap to store the current frequency of each number.
//Thus whenever we push a new number in the heap,
//we will increment its frequency in the HashMap and when we pop, we will decrement its frequency.
//If two numbers have the same frequency, we will need to return the number which was pushed later while popping.
//To resolve this, we need to attach a sequence number to every number to know which number came first.
