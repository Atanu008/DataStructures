//Given a set of positive numbers arr and a value total,
//determine if there exists a subset in the given set whose sum is equal to total.
//A subset can be an empty set, or it can either consist of some elements of the set or all the elements of the set.
//
//Letâ€™s say you are given a set = {1, 2, 3, 7} and a total = 6.
//The output will be TRUE as the subset = {1, 2, 3} adds up to make the desired total (1+2+3) = 6.
