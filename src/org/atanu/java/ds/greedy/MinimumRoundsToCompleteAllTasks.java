//LeetCode 2244

//If the frequency is 1, the task cannot be performed so we return -1.
//If the frequency is 3, the task can be performed and we return frequency/3.
//Now if the frequency is not completely divisible by 3, then the possible remainders are 1 and 2. Lets check them out:

//If remainder is 1, i.e, lets take 7 frequency, then ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®
//the groups are something like this "ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®" "ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®" "ğŸ”®",
//i.e, one ğŸ”® is left alone so the solution is to break the second last group into two parts of 2 and 1
//so that it becomes like: "ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®" "ğŸ”®ğŸ”®" "ğŸ”®ğŸ”®", i.e, one is added to the division by 3.

//If remainder is 2, i.e, lets take 8 frequency, then ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®
//the groups are something like this "ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®" "ğŸ”®ğŸ”®ğŸ”®" "ğŸ”®ğŸ”®", i.e, two ğŸ”® are left
//so the solution is to just add 1,i.e, one group of two to the solution.
